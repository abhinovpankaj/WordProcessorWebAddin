Removing double spaces: The script should remove all double spaces from the document, meaning that whenever there are two or more spaces in a
row, they will be replaced by a single space

Correct usage of non-breaking spaces:
• Whenever there is one of the strings “Art.”, “§”, “Abs.”, “S.”, “Hs.”, “Nr.”, “Ziff.”, “lit.” or “Buchst.” followed by 
a space and a digit, the space must be replaced by a non-breaking space (Unicode: U+00A0; html: &nsbp;). If there is no space
between the string and the digit, a non-breaking space must be inserted.

• Furthermore, if there is there is a digit followed by a space and „%”, “€” or “$” the space should also be replaced by a 
non-breaking space. If there is no space between the digit and the sign, a non-breaking space should be inserted.

• If there a string “Anlage” followed by a space, followed by capital “B” or by capital “K”, followed by another space, followed by 
a number, the spaces must be replaced with non-breaking spaces.

• When a digit is followed by a space and either “f.” or “ff.” the space must be replaced by a non-breaking space

Adding forgotten full stops: If the string “Art” is followed by a space or by a non-breqaking space, and either is then followed by a digit

Correct placement of footnotes: If there a footnote (small number in superscript; inserted by: References / Insert footnote) is placed before a 
full stop, it must be moved behind the full stop.

Correct usage of hyphens:
• If there is a digit, followed by a space, followed by a dash (Unicode: U+2013; html: &ndash;) followed by a space, followed by a digit, 
both spaces must be deleted.
• If there is a digit, followed by a hyphen (Unicode: U+2010; html: &#x2010;), followed by a digit, the hyphen must be replaced by a 
dash (Unicode: U+2013; html: &ndash;)

Citing court decisions correctly: If the string “BGH” is followed by a space and either the string “Urt.” or “Urteil”, a comma must be added before the space.
